### Design rationale
In de Design rationale schrijf je de debriefing, de probleem-definitie, toon je de oplossing en schrijf je een uitleg van de code. 
De Design rationale is een verantwoording van je ontwerp.

## Product biography
In het eindproject doorloop je een iteratief proces. 
Elke week bespreek je met je opdrachtgever je vorderingen en ideeen. 
In de Product biografie hou je stap voor stap bij wat je allemaal hebt gedaan. 
Je schrijft over het proces, de werkwijze en de planning. 
Ook schetsen, testen, uitprobeersels en inspiratie zijn deel van de Product biografie.

## Reflection

| Course  | Rubric  | Achieved | Explanatory note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web-App-From-Scratch | Creating structure into the code, by making use of patterns| 游눜 | Using react creates an object oriented structure. Also working together ensures that you use a certain structure, so that everything will look the same.|
| CSS-To-The-Rescue | Using BEM to structure CSS | 游눜 | For this project I had to learn BEM, because we decided to structure our CSS with this methodology to avoid unnecessary specificity problems.|
|   | Learn new CSS features | 游눜 | Using an ::after and creating small animations. |
| Browser-Technologies | Comprehend a Use Case | 游비 | Though we did this mostly as a group effort, we did create a persona and a user story. Though I feel I could have done more by creating a customer journey map and doing more desk research on the persona's. Luckily the documentation Wallscope provided was very thorough about these target groups. |
|   | Implementing 20 design principles | 游비 | From the beginning I wanted to create an application with **One Primary action per screen**. While later on implementing other design principles from [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/), even though not all design principles are applicable in this prototype. I do feel like I could have done a better job in creating a better user experience design, but in the end there just wasn't enough time. |
|   | Progressive Enhancement | 仇벒잺 | Because of limited time I didn't get around to this. But because the client of the application was build with React the whole application breaks, when turning off Javascript. I could have provided a fallback for my CSS if I had more time.|
|   | Accessibility | 游눜 | Because I was mostly responsible for the designs I did focus a lot on color contrast and accessibility, making sure the application is for everybody. The user is also able navigate the application using only the keyboard and I provided aria-labels wherever necessary. ![Accessibility](./assets/accessibility.png) |
| Web-Design | User tests | 游비 | I agree that we could have done a lot more here. But in the end we did do a user test, where everyone was able to ask their own question that provided us with a lot of insights. It might also be very valuable next time to do an expert test, with someone who knows a lot about user interaction |

* 游눜 = achieved
* 游비 = still in progress
* 仇벒잺 = did not have enough time to complete this
